Customer support can be overwhelming and time-consuming, especially when the ticket volume is high. This project ‚Äî **Customer Ticket Resolver with AI** ‚Äî leverages the power of AI and natural language processing (NLP) to streamline and automate the customer service process. It intelligently classifies support tickets, analyzes their content, and generates possible resolutions or summaries using advanced language models.

The system helps support teams become faster, more accurate, and more consistent in handling user queries by using Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI GPT APIs. The interface is built using **Streamlit** to ensure simplicity and accessibility for non-technical users.

## üß† About MCP (Multi-Class Predictor)

The **MCP** module (Multi-Class Predictor) is the core intelligence engine of the project. It takes raw ticket input (customer issue text) and performs:

1. **Intent Classification** ‚Äì Understands the context or issue type.
2. **Urgency Detection** ‚Äì Predicts how urgent the ticket is.
3. **Resolution Suggestion** ‚Äì Predicts the category and offers relevant resolution paths.
4. **LLM Response Generation** ‚Äì Uses GPT to summarize the issue or draft a response.

> The MCP runs as a backend model server (`mcp_server.py`) that takes ticket inputs and returns structured insights.

## üìä Workflow Overview

```
graph TD
    A[Customer Ticket Input] --> B[Streamlit Form]
    B --> C[MCP Server - NLP & Classification]
    C --> D[LLM Response Generator]
    D --> E[Response Output & Display]
    C --> F[Google Sheet Logger (optional)]
```

### Explanation:
1. The user enters a ticket description in the Streamlit UI.
2. This input is sent to the MCP model server for NLP-based classification.
3. Based on classification, the LLM generates a summary or resolution.
4. The results are presented to the user.
5. Optionally, the ticket is logged using the Google API into a Google Sheet.
